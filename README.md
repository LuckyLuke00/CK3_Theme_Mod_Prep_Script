💾 CK3 Theme Mod Prep Script
=======
This script takes the textures from the *Crusader Kings III* game files needed to create a theme mod and copies them to your specified mod folder. That's it!

⚠️ Warning
-------
If there are already some texture files in the mod folder, the script will overwrite them.
